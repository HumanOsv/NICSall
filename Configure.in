## The XYZ file cartesian coordinates format is a chemical file format.

coords = 10_R5.xyz

## Quality grid of NICS parameters.

quality = 0.1

## Select where does NICSall will be run. 0 Local, 1 Cluster
jobScheduler = 0

## Number of parallel runs, works only with jobScheluder = 0. OPTIONAL
parallel = 3

## The size of the box (in Angstroms) length, width, and height.

box_size = 0, 0, 10

## Choose NMR chemical shieldings (0) or Sigma-Pi separation (1).

option = 1

## Orbitals to perform Sigma-Pi separation.

orbitals = 20,21,22,23,-19,-18,-24,-25

## Nuclear independent chemical shielding (NICS) functions.

type_graph = 1,2,5,8

## Software gaussian (gaussian).

software = gaussian
## How to call Gaussian (COMMAND), works with jobScheluder=0. For Cluster calls NICSall will ALWAYS call a bash script "CallGaussian", with the following arguments:
# $CallGaussian fileName file.com nproc queue
G_Command = g16

## The number of processors and memory (GB).

core_mem = 4,8

## The charge and multiplicity of the candidate.

charge_multi = 0,1

## keywords for gaussian

header = pbe1pbe/def2tzvp

#maxghost = 10

## A model potential be substituted for the core electrons
